package scalaChallenges1

/*
        We'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13-19 (inclusive).
        Write a method named hasTeen with 3 parameters of type int.
        The method should return boolean and it need to return true
        if one of the parameters is in range 13 (inclusive) - 19.
        Otherwise return false.
        Examples of input/output:
        *   hasTeen(9, 99, 19); should return true since 19 is in range 13 - 19
        *   hasTeen(23, 15, 42); should return true since 15 is in range 13 - 19
        *   hasTeen(22, 23, 34); should return false since numbers 22, 23, 34 are not in range 13-19
        Write a method named isTeen with 1 parameter of type int.
        The method should return boolean and it need to return true
        if the parameter is in range 13 (inclusive) - 19 (inclusive).
        Otherwise return false.
